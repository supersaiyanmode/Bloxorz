BUILDING
========

  (On linux)

    g++ -w *.cpp soil/*.c `pkg-config --libs libglfw` -lGLU -lGL -lXrandr
    
  (On Windows)
  
    g++ -w *.cpp soil/*.c -lglfw -lglu32 -lOpengl32 -lgdi32
    

BLOXORZ MAP
===========

The game (as of now) reads the map from the file named "map.txt" located in the
working directory. The map file is essentially represented using the following
ASCII characters:
    
    .           A bad cell; those cells which are 'outside' the floor of the
                game.
    +           The main block. Single '+' in the map implies the block is
                standing vertically. Two adjacent '+'es imply a horizontal
                block
    <space>     The hole in which the block must fall into to finish the game.
    
The map must be surrounded with two layers of bad cells ('.' cells). Look into
the map that comes with the source code.
